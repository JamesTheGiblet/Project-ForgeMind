"ForgeMind" — Autonomous LLM Builder

Tagline: An AI that iteratively designs, trains, and tests its own successors.

1. Core Concept

ForgeMind is an autonomous AI training ecosystem that uses existing LLMs to:


Interpret high-level human goals.

Generate and curate synthetic training datasets.

Fine-tune a target model or module.

Evaluate results against a benchmark.

Self-adjust its strategy and repeat — all while versioning every artifact.

2. System Pillars

Orchestration Brain – decision-making & loop control.

Knowledge Foundry – synthetic + real dataset builder.

Model Forge – LoRA/QLoRA training environment.

Trial Grounds – evaluation & benchmarking.

Lorekeeper – versioning, metadata, provenance tracking.

Warden – safety, policy, and human review controls.

3. New System Flow

Step 1 — Goal Definition


Human or external system sets:

Task: "Code review assistant for Python security best practices"

Success metric: "≥90% pass rate on security test suite"

Constraints: "Use LLaMA-3-8B base, 4-bit LoRA, max $50 GPU budget/iteration"

Step 2 — Data Generation & Curation


Multiple LLM APIs generate labeled examples.

Cross-model validation filters out low-quality data.

Safety module rejects policy-violating content.

Step 3 — Model Training


Runs fine-tuning job (LoRA/QLoRA).

Saves checkpoint + training manifest.

Step 4 — Evaluation


Runs on three test tiers:

Canary tests (fast, early fail detection).

Full benchmark suite (domain accuracy).

Adversarial challenges (stress-test generalization).

Step 5 — Decision & Iteration


If target met → promote to “stable” registry.

If not → orchestrator adjusts prompt strategies, dataset sizes, or hyperparams.

4. Deployment Model

Local mode – runs on a single beefy workstation with GPU (e.g., RTX 4090).

Cluster mode – uses a queue-based orchestrator (e.g., Ray or Prefect) across cloud GPUs.

Hybrid mode – generation done via LLM APIs, training local, eval mixed.

5. Tech Stack

Core language: Python 3.11+

ML stack: Hugging Face Transformers + PEFT + bitsandbytes

Orchestration: Prefect / custom async task loop

Data handling: Pandas, DVC (dataset versioning)

Registry: MLflow / Weights & Biases

Safety layer: OpenAI moderation API, Detoxify, custom regex/AST checkers

Interface:

CLI for scripting automation

Optional lightweight web dashboard for iteration tracking

7. MVP Milestones

Phase 1 — Prototype Loop


Implement a single task loop: generate → fine-tune → evaluate → adjust.

Target: run 3 iterations with clear improvement trend.

Phase 2 — Safety & Versioning


Add filters, dataset/model registry, basic dashboard.

Phase 3 — Multi-Agent Generation


Use multiple LLMs for dataset creation and adversarial cases.

Phase 4 — Parallel Experimentation


Orchestrator tests multiple dataset/hyperparam configs in parallel, picks winner.

8. Why This is a New System

Not just a feature — it’s a closed-loop AI engineering ecosystem.
