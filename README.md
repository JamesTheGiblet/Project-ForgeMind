# ðŸŒ€ ForgeMind: Autonomous LLM Builder

**Tagline**: An AI that builds, trains, and tests its own successors.

-----

### **1. Core Concept**

ForgeMind is an AI training system that uses existing LLMs to:

  * Figure out what a human wants to build.
  * Make and clean up its own training data.
  * Fine-tune a target model.
  * Check its work against a benchmark.
  * Adjust its strategy and try againâ€”all while keeping track of every step.

-----

### **2. System Pillars**

  * **The Brain**: This is the decision-maker, controlling the whole loop.
  * **The Foundry**: Where we build all the synthetic and real datasets.
  * **The Forge**: Our environment for training models (LoRA/QLoRA).
  * **The Trial Grounds**: Where we run all the evaluations and benchmarks.
  * **The Lorekeeper**: Keeps track of versions, metadata, and where everything came from.
  * **The Warden**: Our controls for safety, policy, and human review.

-----

### **3. The System Flow**

**Step 1 â€” Define the Goal**

A human or another system sets:

  * **Task**: "Code review assistant for Python security best practices."
  * **Success**: "At least 90% pass rate on our security test suite."
  * **Limits**: "Use LLaMA-3-8B base, 4-bit LoRA, max $50 GPU budget per try."

**Step 2 â€” Make & Clean Data**

  * Multiple LLM APIs generate labeled examples.
  * We use other models to filter out bad data.
  * A safety module rejects anything that violates our rules.

**Step 3 â€” Train the Model**

  * Runs a fine-tuning job.
  * Saves the checkpoint and a training manifest.

**Step 4 â€” Evaluate**

  * Runs on three test tiers:
      * **Canary tests**: Fast, to catch early failures.
      * **Full benchmark**: For deep accuracy checks.
      * **Adversarial challenges**: To stress-test how it handles unexpected situations.

**Step 5 â€” Decide & Iterate**

  * If the goal is met â†’ promote the model to a "stable" registry.
  * If not â†’ the brain adjusts its prompt strategies, dataset sizes, or training settings.

-----

### **4. Deployment Model**

  * **Local mode**: Runs on a single powerful workstation with a GPU (e.g., RTX 4090).
  * **Cluster mode**: Uses a queue-based orchestrator (like Ray or Prefect) across cloud GPUs.
  * **Hybrid mode**: Data generation happens via LLM APIs, with training and evaluation running locally.

-----

### **5. Tech Stack**

  * **Core language**: Python 3.11+
  * **ML stack**: Hugging Face Transformers + PEFT + bitsandbytes
  * **Orchestration**: Prefect / custom async task loop
  * **Data handling**: Pandas, DVC (for dataset versioning)
  * **Registry**: MLflow / Weights & Biases
  * **Safety layer**: OpenAI moderation API, Detoxify, custom regex/AST checkers
  * **Interface**:
      * CLI for scripting automation
      * Optional lightweight web dashboard for tracking progress

### **7. MVP Milestones**

  * **Phase 1 â€” Prototype Loop**: Build a single task loop: generate â†’ fine-tune â†’ evaluate â†’ adjust.
      * **Goal**: Run 3 iterations with a clear improvement trend.
  * **Phase 2 â€” Safety & Versioning**: Add filters, a dataset/model registry, and a basic dashboard.
  * **Phase 3 â€” Multi-Agent Generation**: Use multiple LLMs for dataset creation and adversarial cases.
  * **Phase 4 â€” Parallel Experimentation**: The brain tests multiple dataset/hyperparameter configurations in parallel and picks the winner.

How does this revised blueprint for ForgeMind feel? Does it capture the raw, honest, and process-driven spirit of **The Giblet's Workshop**?
